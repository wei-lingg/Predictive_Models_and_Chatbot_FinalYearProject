      "<p><strong>By James Yeo</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>Buying life insurance is a common headache for many working adults. They know that the coverage is important for their dependents but, at the same time, they are often overwhelmed by the array of complicated policies available from different insurers.</p>\n",
      "<p>It also doesn’t help that the insurance industry in Singapore appears to have a bad rap as there are always cases where people are talked into buying insurance policies meant to feed the agents’ pockets instead.</p>\n",
      "<p>With that in mind, we have asked around and come up with the top five questions people normally have regarding life insurance.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>1) How much is the monthly premium?</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>The most common question is almost always about the price tag, because people know that buying insurance is a life-long commitment. On paper, the premium will depend on the person’s age, gender, the number of years payable, their work environment, and so on.</p>\n",
      "<p>However, this can be rather vague to the layman.</p>\n",
      "<p>Luckily, we found that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has come up with an interactive online portal named compareFIRST, in partnership with industry partners. The portal allows you to easily compare the premiums and features of life insurance products. You can even customise your search by choosing parameters such as the coverage amount, premium payment period and the inclusion of critical illness riders.</p>\n",
      "<p>Here’s a simple illustration:</p>\n",
      "<p>You can even sort and compare the list of products available.</p>\n",
      "<p>Based on the needs of a 29-year-old male non-smoker who is interested in Whole-Life products (with critical illness benefit), sum assured of $100,000 and a premium payable to 70 years old, the monthly payments according to compareFIRST range from $137.75 to $213.25.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>2) How much coverage do i need</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>If you have been keeping up with the news, you might have come across articles saying how underinsured Singaporeans are. A poll done by insurer Prudential indicated the following: Some 85 per cent of respondents were potentially under-insured by industry standards, with only 5 times their annual earnings set aside as contingency funds for unexpected personal and financial events.</p>\n",
      "<p>A check with an employee of NTUC Income who wanted to be identified as Edwina says that the industry rule of thumb is to have 5 to 10 times your annual income as basic life cover. This means that, if you earn $5,000 a month, it would be prudent to opt for coverage of $300,000 to $600,000.</p>\n",
      "<p>That said, Edwina also says that this amount differs from case to case,because the longer you expect to take care of your dependents, the more you would need. Your financial adviser representative would probably be best placed to evaluate your protection needs.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>3) What does the policy cover?</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>It is important to know what you are getting when purchasing a lifelong plan. Here is what you should be asking about the plan’s coverage:</p>\n",
      "<p>What will my insurance policy cover?</p>\n",
      "<p>What kind of benefits and limitations does it have?</p>\n",
      "<p>Will it meet all my insurance protection needs?</p>\n",
      "<p>What exclusions are there?</p>\n",
      "<p>If I already have some life insurance coverage, how does the recommended policy help me?</p>\n",
      "<p>Don’t worry too much if this is overwhelming to you. Check with your insurance agent and he/she would have to go through the details above with you.</p>\n",
      "<p>Furthermore, according to Amanda from Great Eastern Advisors’ Clique, one should be aware that buying a plan is not comprehensive enough. It is also wise to add a couple of riders to the plan, such as an income protection rider which covers your monthly income up to a certain percentage until one turns 65 years old, early stage critical illness protection, accident plans, etc.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>4) Which one should you get: Whole Life vs Term insurance?</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>There isn’t a <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:right or wrong\" href=\"http://dollarsandsense.sg/term-and-whole-life-insurance-which-is-better/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">right or wrong</a> answer to the above question, as it depends broadly on your needs at various life stages, as well your preferences.</p>\n",
      "<p>The main differences between whole life and term insurance boils down to their coverage period and the premiums.</p>\n",
      "<p>As the name suggests, a whole life policy provides coverage for “life” and includes a savings element, such that there would be a death benefit payout provided by the insurance company if the policyholder dies.</p>\n",
      "<p>On the other hand, term insurance covers the policyholder for a certain period, usually until 65 or 70 years old. While this is much cheaper than whole life plans, it does not have a cash value at the end of your policy. As such, advocates of term insurance generally practise the rule of “Buy Term, Invest the Rest”.</p>\n",
      "<p>To sum up, it usually depends on whether the person is investment-savvy and willing to invest the premium savings. I have heard of many risk-averse friends who are more open to buying these insurance policies and treating it as a long-term savings plan instead.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>5) What is the payout procedure like when it comes to claims?</strong></p>\n",
      "<p>According to the Life Insurance Association Singapore, there are still more than 8,000 unclaimed insurance payouts in Singapore – so they have come up with an online register <a class=\"link rapid-noclick-resp\" data-ylk=\"slk:here\" href=\"http://www.lia.org.sg/consumers/unclaimed-proceeds/list\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Nowadays, one can easily go online to submit a claim by preparing the required documents, such as identification documents and proof of relationship as well as filling up the claim form.</p>\n",
      "<p>Alternatively, if you are still having a difficult time, you could also look for the claimant’s financial planner who would be well-versed in this area for further advice.</p>\n",

Feedzai’s platform is used by the world’s leading financial institutions, payment providers, and merchants to manage the risk of financial crime while enabling an optimized experience for end-users.

In addition, Feedzai’s technology allows a more seamless, real-time experience for consumers. Feedzai’s core offering originally focused on identifying transaction fraud, but in recent years has leveraged the underlying technology to expand into adjacencies such as anti-money laundering and account opening – making Feedzai one of the most comprehensive cloud-based financial crime prevention platforms in the market. The investment comes as demand for Feedzai’s technology is accelerating alongside the rapid shift to digital banking and commerce, which has led to a significant increase in consumers becoming victims of financial crime.

Today, Feedzai monitors companies with more than 800 million customers in 190 countries, with products protecting half of the U.K.’s and Canada’s populations, as well as four of the five largest banks in North America.

Every time someone opens a bank account, transfers money, or makes a payment with their mobile device, they are experiencing transparency, convenience, and protection in 3 milliseconds or less - all made possible by Feedzai’s AI platform. “Feedzai’s technology is the cornerstone of today’s commerce as consumers across the globe expect fast, reliable, seamless, and, above all, secure banking and payment experiences. The world has faster digitization requirements, and financial institutions need reliable solutions that thrive in this new digital environment in days, not months,” said Nuno Sebastiao, CEO and Chairman of Feedzai. “We’re thrilled to be working with KKR to bring more innovation into this space and to keep protecting our customers from an ever-evolving financial crime landscape.” \"Feedzai offers a powerful solution to one of the biggest challenges we are facing today: financial crime in the digital age. Global commerce depends on future-proof technologies capable of dealing with a rapidly evolving threat landscape. At the same time, consumers rightfully demand a great customer experience, in addition to strong security layers when using banking or payments services,” said Stephen Shanley, Managing Director at KKR. Spencer Chavez, Principal at KKR, continued, “We believe Feedzai’s platform uniquely meets these expectations and more, and we are looking forward to working with Nuno and the rest of the team to expand their offering even further.” The investment follows the close of another exceptional financial year where Feedzai saw significant growth in all its geographic markets and customer verticals.

The estimated cash breakeven for the vessel upon delivery is about USD 10,900 per day including operational expenses. Belships will pay a sum of USD 2.9 mill upon signing contract, expected to occur during April 2021, and which will be financed from available cash. The agreement comes with purchase options below current market values and can be exercised after the third year until the end of the charter. There are no obligations to purchase the vessel.The agreement is conditional upon certain subjects being lifted by the parties involved. Conclusion is expected within April 2021.Belships is again taking over an existing contract for a brand new vessel soon ready for delivery whilst the orderbook approaches the lowest levels seen in 30 years. This vessel transaction signals the competitive advantage Belships has in sourcing ship finance. Belships’ fleet continues to increase and improve with only modest cash investments.The previously announced sale of BELFORT has been completed and the vessel has been delivered to its new owners. Following completion of announced transactions, the Belships fleet will count 24 Supramax/Ultramax bulk carriers, with an average age of 5 years.Belships has a uniform and modern fleet of bulk carriers well positioned to capitalise on a recovery for vessel values. We are focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. Our strategy is to continue developing Belships as an owner and operator of geared bulk carriers, through quality of operations and accretive growth opportunities.
