0,1. What are the first types of policies I should get?,"The first thing to note about insurance is that there are many different kinds, suited to different needs. Protection-type policies protect you from unforeseen circumstances, endowment policies focus on savings, and investment-linked policies (ILP) are customisable schemes that help you grow your money, subject to market risk.Jumping into ILPs may seem enticing, but for beginners like you and I who are a little more conservative, the pros recommend starting off with a hospitalisation plan first. As Y.S., a manager at a local financial advisory firm puts it, having to get hospitalised without a policy to cover you renders all other plans useless, as your funds will all go towards paying your bills.Once you’ve got your basic hospitalisation plan covered, you can move on to exploring other protection-type insurance plans such as disability insurance, critical illness coverage and life insurance. This’ll ensure that you’ve got all your healthcare bases covered. After all, what good is wealth accumulation if you’re not alive and kicking to spend all that moolah?"
1,2. How much should I be insured for?,"As much as you may wear your kiasu–ism like a badge of honour, you don’t want to apply this logic when it comes to insurance. Over-insuring is an actual thing, which means that you’ll be spending unnecessary money on higher premiums than needed.The amount of money that you’re insured for affects the price of your premiums, so it’s important that you’re insured for just the right amount.Based on guidelines from the Life Insurance Association, Lorna Tan, Head of Financial Planning Literacy at DBS Bank, suggests that you get insured for about nine times your annual income in case of death. As for critical illness insurance, get about five years of your expenses covered, as that is typically the amount of time the average person needs to recuperate from a critical illness.Even if you’re new to the insurance game, you’re likely to have some sort of existing insurance policies under your parents, CPF Savings and deposit savings. It’s important to take them into account when working out your insurance gaps.To prevent yourself from over- or under-insuring, you can also check out the DBS NAV Planner to help you keep track of your insurance needs. It’ll give you precise, personalised calculations on how much insurance you’ll need depending on your dependants, life stage and income. You’ll even get suggestions on how your insurance cover might change over time."
2,3. What percentage of my savings should be set aside for insurance?,"As with the amount of money you set aside for insurance, this depends on your dependants, income and expenditure. If you’ve not built up an emergency fund yet, Lorna urges that you settle this before anything else. For most people, that would be three to six months of your expenses. But if you’re self-employed, it would be better to save up to 12 months instead.It’s more important to have all your bases covered at least a little, rather than stretch yourself too thin trying to pay unnecessarily hefty premiums, or put too many eggs in one basket while leaving other areas uninsured."
3,4. What common mistakes should I avoid when buying my first policy?,"One common mistake pointed out by the professionals is that people tend to rush into buying their first policy. As ‘M.N.’, a Financial Services Consultant points out, different insurance policies can get very confusing with many overlapping features. A good tip provided by Danielle Chia and Joe Liao, both Wealth Planning Managers at DBS, is to assess your financial situation and understand your insurance needs before shopping around for a suitable cover. This way, you won’t end up blindly purchasing a policy that you’ll struggle to pay premiums for.They added that you should not focus only on the premiums to pay, but also look at the guaranteed vs non-guaranteed parts of the policy illustration, so that you’ll have a bigger picture of how the policy will benefit you.To help you decide on a policy, here’s a checklist provided by Lorna, Head of Financial Planning Literacy at DBS:"
4,5. How do I file an insurance claim and how long does it take?,"Filing an insurance claim varies from agency to agency, but most of them will have a company portal that’ll guide you through submitting your claims. Besides ensuring that you’ve got the proper documentation, do a double check to make sure that all the information is accurate – else the process of claiming your payout may take longer.Most insurance claims take up to two weeks to process – the fastest being a few working days, according to ‘A.L.’, a Financial Consultant. However, serious and complicated claims can take longer, and factors like third-party involvement and waiting periods may delay the process. Filing claims can get stressful, so don’t be afraid to approach your financial planner for help instead of trying to tackle that mountain of paperwork alone. As certified Life Planner, ‘K.F.’, aptly puts, it’s always good to have a trusted agent settle your claims for you, especially when you have a hundred and one other more important things to settle in life."
5,6. Do I need to pay more when I make a claim?,"Although insurance plans do help to cover most of your expensive hospital bills, you’ll also be expected to foot some of the bill yourself in the form of deductibles and copayments. Deductibles are the minimum amount you’ll have to pay for your insurance before you can get a payout from your insurance. Copayments are the amount that you split with the insurer after paying your deductibles.Depending on your insurance provider, some policies may not cover certain illnesses or accidents. For example, most health insurance policies will not pay for cosmetic surgeries or new medical technologies. To get payouts from your insurance, most will also require proof such as medical reports, which can cost anywhere from $10 to $480."
6,7. How often should I update my insurance policy over the years?,"Our needs and goals change as we grow older – which is why it’s important for us to review our insurance policies. As advised by financial advisory manager, ‘Y.S.’, annual reviews with your advisor will help you decide which policies are the best to meet your present and future needs.As your passive income increases, you can also delve into savings and investment plans based on your current needs, as shared by ‘A.L.’, a Financial Consultant. However, ‘K.F.’ also mentions that, from his knowledge as a Life Planner, it’s important to gradually increase your insurance coverage in preparation of unexpected health problems that might come as you age. Building up bit by bit will give you more peace of mind, without forking out too much early on when you’ve just ventured into the working world."
0,# 1 What Affects My life Insurance Premiums?,"Insurance is all about managing risks, be it from yourself or your surroundings.Unsurprisingly, age is a factor that determines your premiums since there’s a higher chance of you getting sick later in your life.Similarly, men have a statistically shorter lifespan compared to women, so premiums are higher for men too.An infamous factor for insurance premium increase – smoking status – is involved as well. There are smokers who lie about their smoking status, but it only results in an invalid claim later in their lives if it was found that they smoked. It is easy to detect smoking status via blood tests, or if cross-referenced with prior health checkups or doctor visits.Other factors include your health status as determined by your health checkup before purchasing the insurance, family history, and the job you take on as well.Personal accident plans consider your occupation as well, since different occupations have different risk classes."
1,# 2 Do I Need A Medical Exam?,"A medical exam is almost always part of the life insurance purchase process. You need to take the medical exam to demonstrate to the insurance company that you’re not a risky customer.No-medical underwriting policies exist, but typically these policies have lower limit for sum assured to reflect the risk that the company.On the bright side, if you undergo a medical exam, you would know whether you’re health or otherwise."
2,# 3 What If My Employer/School Already Bought Life Insurance For Me?,"A very common question that we encounter, but the equally common answer is “no”. While your workplace offers life insurance as a perk, the payout is usually too little.Furthermore, there is the risk of losing your job at any point in time and with it, your life insurance plan. A good perk is that sometimes no medical underwriting is required, meaning even employees with health issues may benefit from group plans at the workplace.How about students? A casual look at National University of Singapore’s group insurance plan reveals that the payout upon accidental death is only $30,000, which is too little as a normal plan. The payout other universities, polytechnics, and ITEs is similarly low as well. There is very little control you have as a student if you only subscribe to your educational institution’s group plan.As such, it is recommended to get a private plan to supplement your existing ones."
3,# 4 What Kinds Of Life Insurance Are There?,"There are two (or more, depending who you ask) kinds of life insurance, differentiated based on the term length.First is whole life insurance, which protects you over your lifetime.The second, is term life insurance. As its name implies it protects you over a fixed time period.The last one is direct insurance products. It is different from the other two because direct insurance products do not involve financial advisers and are generally bought directly from insurance company branches or purchased online.How about the pros and cons of each? There is an ongoing debate about the merits and demerits of both, with no clear winner in sight. The comparison is a whole different matter to be explore in another article, another time."

0,Types of insurance in Singapore,"If you’re in your 20s, insurance isn’t likely to be among your fave things to talk or think about. Disease, death and disaster are probably the last things on your mind. Of course you haven’t started planning for those events.So you’re probably totally unprepared when your ex-schoolmate, who’s now at Prudential, meets you for coffee and asks you that dreaded question… “What kind of insurance coverage do you have?” (Probably zilch, right?)You may feel rather embarrassed to reply honestly. But that’s actually pretty normal for young Singaporeans. Don’t feel too pressured to commit to an insurance plan until you’ve gathered enough information.For a start, do you even know what insurance is?You might have an inkling that it’s supposed to help you when things are bad, like if you fall ill or someone dies. But insurance is first and foremost a financial product. You can’t call your insurance agent for a free therapy session, because that’s not her real job. Her job is to help with the paperwork so you can get hold of a financial payout.And did you know that there are not 1, not 2, but over 20 different types of insurance? The most common types that younger Singaporeans would know about are:There’s also:Basically, anything you can imagine spending money on, there’s probably some form of insurance for it.Back to top"
1,Top 5 insurance companies in Singapore,"There are hundreds(!) of insurance companies in Singapore, so it’d be crazy to list them all out. But you would definitely have heard of the top 5 insurance companies in Singapore…Other names that you might have heard of are FWD, AXA, Manulife and Tokio Marine. These are not quite as big in Singapore, but still have a substantial share of the market.Note, though, that big doesn’t always mean best. While “branded” insurers like GE or Prudential do give you that feeling of assurance, they might not necessarily offer the best plans or most affordable premiums. It’s always good to know what you’re looking for in each product and be able to compare insurance plans from different companies.Back to top "
2,Life insurance in Singapore — what is it & who should get it?,"A life insurance policy pays a certain sum of money (known as “sum assured” in insurance jargon) when something bad happens to you – accident, injury, total permanent disability (TPD) or death. Usually the payout varies depending on how severe the outcome is. It’s meant to compensate your reduced earning ability – so it’s not pegged to the cost of medical treatment, for example.The money is meant to help your family if you’re not able to support them or are no longer around to do so. So, it’s really only necessary when you have kids, or if you have other dependents such as siblings or parents.When you’re considering buying life insurance, the terms “whole life” and “term” will definitely crop up. Don’t be fazed. They are just 2 types of life insurance.Term life insurance: The cheaper of the two, term life insures you for the duration you choose (10 to 30 years). You’d usually choose this if you’re concerned about family, as the term should cover your life up until your kids are financially independent. Here’s an example:With term life, the main “drawback” is that you don’t get a single dollar back if you survive the term without dying or getting into an accident. Whole life insurance: This variation covers you for life and is a lot more expensive. And we mean a lot. Like, $500/year (term life) vs $13,000/year (whole life) kind of “a lot”.Despite this stark difference, many Singaporeans like to buy whole life insurance because there is a cash payout you can get at some point… even if you haven’t died by then. Here’s an example:There are many subtypes of whole life insurance. Endowment plans are a common one. These function as a retirement savings plan or education savings plan, with the idea that you get a big payout when it’s time to retire or your child goes to uni.Another popular type is ILP (investment-linked plan) which is sort of an investment plan with an insurance feature built into it. It’s undeniably attractive, but with any investment product, there are risks involved.For more about life insurance, read Life Insurance in Singapore – The Basics of Whole Life and Term Insurance.When you get to the point of needing to buy life insurance, you would have a better idea of what sort of sum assured you want.If you’re wondering how much insurance coverage you need, a common rule of thumb for the sum assured is “11 times your annual income”.This means that if you’re earning $2,800 a month as an entry-level executive, you’ll need life insurance with a sum assured of $369,600.But really, the sum assured varies from case to case, because the amount is really how much money your family needs to survive comfortably without you.Back to top "

5,Health insurance in Singapore — what should you know before buying?,"Health insurance covers the costs of healthcare in Singapore (which as we all know, isn’t exactly cheap). This includes hospital bills, medical treatments and possibly other health-related expenses. Imagine you get into an accident – non-fatal, thankfully – and are hospitalised. If you buy life insurance, you’d get a cash payout to help your dependents get by while you’re unable to work. Whereas with health insurance, you’d submit the hospital bill to the insurer and get them to foot most of it.Sounds pretty good, right?Actually, all Singaporeans and PRs already have basic health insurance – MediShield Life. You’ve been paying the premiums through your CPF MediSave account. However, MediShield Life coverage is basic. Generally it pays for your hospitalisation bill, but only in a B or C ward at a public hospital. If you want to stay in an A ward, you’d have to top up yourself. And post-hospitalisation recovery – like follow-up visits to the doc – are generally not covered.Think of it this way. MediShield Life is like the cheapest phone plan offered by your telco, but it only gives you 1GB of data and 30 minutes of talktime. You could live with those limits… but if you exceed them, you need to top up.Many Singaporeans choose to boost that basic coverage with an Integrated Shield Plan (IP). It’s like upgrading to a better plan with a more reasonable 6GB of data. IPs cover you at A wards or even private hospitals so you can receive better medical care.You’ll need to pay more for an IP, but the good news is that you can use your CPF MediShield – up to the MediShield withdrawal limits – for those premiums. Finally, there are also these things called “riders” you can add on to your IP. Think of these as the bells and whistles that you add on to your mobile data plan – caller ID, unlimited phone calls, and whatnot. You need to pay for these extras with cash.For a more in-depth look at your options, read Health Insurance in Singapore – Everything You Need to Know to Survive 2021. Oh, and if you’re wondering when the best time to buy health insurance is… it’s now. Or ASAP.No, we’re not secretly an insurance company trying to pressure you into buying. The younger and healthier you are, the cheaper your premium. Of course, make sure you know what you’re signing up for.Back to top "

7,Travel insurance in Singapore — how do you choose the right one?,"Travel insurance is especially important for Singaporeans with wanderlust.You never know when you will get stranded in an airport because of an airport strike, get your favourite LV bag ripped during a tuk tuk ride (true story) or get food poisoning from hand-picked strawberries (another true story). While these scenarios don’t sound exactly life-threatening, they can be very costly. Imagine having to pay for a night’s stay at airport hotel when you’re on a backpacker budget.Travel insurance will compensate for expenses incurred in these common scenarios:Many also come bundled with some form of emergency assistance feature, where the insurer will either arrange for aid or evacuate you back to Singapore in case of an accident or severe illness.Travel insurance is generally pretty cheap. You can get insured for a week in Asia for less than $30. You can get family/group packages which are even cheaper per person.But when choosing a travel insurance plan, apart from the price, you should also at least glance at the above benefits to make sure nothing is amiss. Also, learn to read the “Exclusions” part of the policy wording because that’s the insurer’s favourite thing to cite when they refuse to pay out your claims.Try to buy travel insurance as soon as you’ve confirmed your trip, otherwise you won’t be able to claim anything in the unlikely event that your tour agency dissolves in the meantime.For more about travel insurance, read Travel Insurance in Singapore – The Total Guide to What You Must Know.If you travel a lot — like 7 or 8 times a year — consider getting annual travel insurance so you don’t have to keep searching for a plan (and reading T&Cs) each time.Back to top "
8,Other types of insurance you might come across,"Consider yourself lucky if travel insurance is the only type of insurance you’ve ever had to buy. As you earn more money and move on to different stages in life, you’ll find yourself needing more and more forms of insurance. The more you own, the more you need (or will feel pressured) to “protect”. The moment you buy a home, buy a car, have a child or start a business, you’ll probably need to get it insured. Here’s a list of common types of insurance in Singapore that are linked to life stages:Click on the links to read our articles about that type of insurance.Back to top "
9,Final note: it pays to compare insurance in Singapore,"As you can see from this monster of an article, buying insurance in Singapore isn’t easy. If you have trouble deciding which bubble tea variation you want at Koi, it’s going to be so much worse when you start buying insurance.The problem is, most Singaporeans are pressured to start buying insurance — particularly life insurance — when we’re young. And often, our decisions are made solely based on whatever our insurance agent friends say.That’s kind of like only ever ordering the Lemon Yakult Juice at Koi because your friend said it’s nice. You’ll be missing out the Black Tea Macchiato, Hazelnut Milk Tea and Ice Cream Ovaltine. Which are all cheaper, by the way.So when you’re buying insurance, don’t limit your options. It’s good to research and compare different policies available.You don’t have to go from company to company to get quotes, as there are online aggregators to make it easier … like us! Use MoneySmart to easily compare general insurance such as travel insurance, car insurance and personal accident insurance. For health and life insurance, simple leave your details and we’ll get back to you with a personalised quote.Some insurance policies, such as IPs, have a “free-look period” too. During this period (14 or 21 days for IP) you can review your policy to make sure it meets your needs. You can terminate the policy in writing within this period and get a refund on your premiums if you’re not happy with it.Back to topKnow someone who needs to read this primer to insurance?

You must keep in mind, which it is better to buy a smaller policy with premiums which you can comfortably afford than to buy a bigger policy where you have to let lapse because you can’t afford the premiums."
4,#5 Need To Take A Medical Exam To Get A Life Insurance Policy? ,"Yes, a medical exam is almost and always part of the traditional life insurance underwriting process. Because the insurance company wants to get an idea of how likely you are to die during your policy’s term. It’s a physical exam where your pulse, height, weight, blood sample, urine sample, and all that stuff is included.It’s important to make sure you’re getting the best coverage for you and your loved ones, and asking right questions upfront can help steer you in the right direction.

0,1.    Reputation / Financial Health Of Your Insurer,"

When it comes to buying things that require a huge financial commitment, the credibility of the seller is an important pre-requisite. When you buy a resale flat, you would do cross-checks on the home seller from whom you are buying. When buying a second-hand car, you would consult your friends or forums on the credibility of various car dealers. Likewise, when buying insurance, the same kind of checks should also be done.

Insurance is essentially a contract of agreement between you and the insurer that offers you financial protection. It is a long-term contractual commitment from your insurer to you that could easily last 20, 30 years or even a lifetime. Thus, you want to make sure that your insurer is not at risk of going bankrupt, so that they can meet their contractual obligations and provide the payouts as promised. 

The kind of financial worries you could face if your insurer becomes bankrupt is unimaginable. Not only would you have to fight to get your premiums back, you would also have to source for a new insurance plan. What’s worse is that you won’t get the same kind of deal you had initially because the risk of insuring you will most likely increase over the years. 

For starters, you may want to examine the credit rating of the insurer, given by one of the three credit rating agencies (Standard & Poors (S&P), Fitch, Moody’s). Each insurer is given a credit rating that defines how likely they are able to meet their financial obligations, including the contractual obligation with you. Another thing which you can do is to check whether the insurer is a SDIC Policy Owner’s Protection Scheme (PPF) member. Under the PPF Scheme, you will get protection for the obligations that the insurer had promised you in the event they go bust (subject to caps where applicable). You won’t have to worry as much given SDIC’s safeguard for you.

1,2.    How Your Insurance Works,"

An important factor to consider when buying insurance is whether you really understand how it works.

If you ask your friends whether they own an insurance policy, most of them might say yes. But if you ask them whether they know what their insurance protects them against, they might not be able to give you a satisfactory answer, let alone explain to you how their insurance works. As an insurance policyholder, it is important for you to know what you are paying for!

We are not saying that you need to know the whole mechanics behind insurance (like how it is priced or how the benefits work). However, you should be aware of the different circumstances under which you can make claims on your insurance policy. This will help you to get a clear idea on the kind of protection you need before you commit to buy the insurance. Understanding how your insurance works and circumstances under which you can make claims  will also help you to avoid having overlapping coverage. Thus, having a good financial advisor who is able to summarise how your insurance works is important.

2,3.    Does Your Insurance Suit Your Needs?,"

Before you make the financial commitment to buy insurance, ask yourself this question: How does this insurance plan fit into my needs? Every type of insurance plan is meant to offer financial protection for different aspects of your life. 

For example, health insurance is meant to offset your potential hospitalisation bills. On the other hand, life insurance is meant to offer financial protection for your loved ones should a life changing event (e.g. accident or disability) or death take place. Critical Illness (CI) insurance pays you a lump sum upon diagnosis of a CI so that you can defray your medical costs and maintain your current lifestyle while recuperating.

Thus, you need to be very clear about the purpose of owning the insurance plan and how it fits into your financial game plan. If not, you will end up spending money on a protection plan that doesn’t suit your needs. It is recommended that you review your insurance regularly given that your needs can change as you progress into different stages of life.

3,"4.    Think About Protection Needs First, Then Consider Your Wants","

The primary objective of buying insurance is for protection, especially for your loved ones. But most people find insurance both morbid and unexciting, especially when we are paying premiums without “seeing any real tangible benefits”. Thus, it is human nature to seek more exciting financial products like investments where we can see our money growing. 

However, insurance is the foundation of financial planning. It is a need, rather than a want. You cannot start your financial planning by thinking about investments first. Rather, you need to start your financial planning by first thinking about the types of insurance you need. 

Protection needs like hospitalisation and surgical expenses, death, total and permanent disability, and critical illness coverage are basic insurance coverage to protect you or your dependants against an undesired situation. Once you have covered the basics, you can then start to explore the good-to-haves like investments or saving plans.

4,"5.    Keep Your Insurance Premium Affordable, Avoid Overbudgeting","

Since insurance is the cornerstone of financial planning, you should get as much of it as you can, right? Well, not quite. Besides considering whether you need the amount of financial protection that you are seeking, you also need to consider whether you are able to afford the premiums. If you overcommit on your insurance budget, it can be detrimental to your financial game plan. 

Overcommitting your insurance budget can lead to unwanted early termination of your insurance policy. This happens when you are unable to continue paying your premiums due to other financial commitments (e.g. housing, marriage or car loans) or even retrenchment. You might end up having to forfeit protection that you really need.

0,By James Yeo,"Buying life insurance is a common headache for many working adults. They know that the coverage is important for their dependents but, at the same time, they are often overwhelmed by the array of complicated policies available from different insurers.It also doesn’t help that the insurance industry in Singapore appears to have a bad rap as there are always cases where people are talked into buying insurance policies meant to feed the agents’ pockets instead.With that in mind, we have asked around and come up with the top five questions people normally have regarding life insurance.1) How much is the monthly premium?The most common question is almost always about the price tag, because people know that buying insurance is a life-long commitment. On paper, the premium will depend on the person’s age, gender, the number of years payable, their work environment, and so on.However, this can be rather vague to the layman.Luckily, we found that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has come up with an interactive online portal named compareFIRST, in partnership with industry partners. The portal allows you to easily compare the premiums and features of life insurance products. You can even customise your search by choosing parameters such as the coverage amount, premium payment period and the inclusion of critical illness riders.Here’s a simple illustration:You can even sort and compare the list of products available.Based on the needs of a 29-year-old male non-smoker who is interested in Whole-Life products (with critical illness benefit), sum assured of $100,000 and a premium payable to 70 years old, the monthly payments according to compareFIRST range from $137.75 to $213.25.2) How much coverage do i needIf you have been keeping up with the news, you might have come across articles saying how underinsured Singaporeans are. A poll done by insurer Prudential indicated the following: Some 85 per cent of respondents were potentially under-insured by industry standards, with only 5 times their annual earnings set aside as contingency funds for unexpected personal and financial events.A check with an employee of NTUC Income who wanted to be identified as Edwina says that the industry rule of thumb is to have 5 to 10 times your annual income as basic life cover. This means that, if you earn $5,000 a month, it would be prudent to opt for coverage of $300,000 to $600,000.That said, Edwina also says that this amount differs from case to case,because the longer you expect to take care of your dependents, the more you would need. Your financial adviser representative would probably be best placed to evaluate your protection needs.3) What does the policy cover?It is important to know what you are getting when purchasing a lifelong plan. Here is what you should be asking about the plan’s coverage:Don’t worry too much if this is overwhelming to you. Check with your insurance agent and he/she would have to go through the details above with you.Furthermore, according to Amanda from Great Eastern Advisors’ Clique, one should be aware that buying a plan is not comprehensive enough. It is also wise to add a couple of riders to the plan, such as an income protection rider which covers your monthly income up to a certain percentage until one turns 65 years old, early stage critical illness protection, accident plans, etc.4) Which one should you get: Whole Life vs Term insurance?There isn’t a right or wrong answer to the above question, as it depends broadly on your needs at various life stages, as well your preferences.The main differences between whole life and term insurance boils down to their coverage period and the premiums.As the name suggests, a whole life policy provides coverage for “life” and includes a savings element, such that there would be a death benefit payout provided by the insurance company if the policyholder dies.On the other hand, term insurance covers the policyholder for a certain period, usually until 65 or 70 years old. While this is much cheaper than whole life plans, it does not have a cash value at the end of your policy. As such, advocates of term insurance generally practise the rule of “Buy Term, Invest the Rest”.To sum up, it usually depends on whether the person is investment-savvy and willing to invest the premium savings. I have heard of many risk-averse friends who are more open to buying these insurance policies and treating it as a long-term savings plan instead.5) What is the payout procedure like when it comes to claims?According to the Life Insurance Association Singapore, there are still more than 8,000 unclaimed insurance payouts in Singapore – so they have come up with an online register here.Nowadays, one can easily go online to submit a claim by preparing the required documents, such as identification documents and proof of relationship as well as filling up the claim form.Alternatively, if you are still having a difficult time, you could also look for the claimant’s financial planner who would be well-versed in this area for further advice."

You can even customise your search by choosing parameters such as the coverage amount, premium payment period and the inclusion of critical illness riders.Here’s a simple illustration:You can even sort and compare the list of products available.Based on the needs of a 29-year-old male non-smoker who is interested in Whole-Life products (with critical illness benefit), sum assured of $100,000 and a premium payable to 70 years old, the monthly payments according to compareFIRST range from $137.75 to $213.25.2) How much coverage do i needIf you have been keeping up with the news, you might have come across articles saying how underinsured Singaporeans are. A poll done by insurer Prudential indicated the following: Some 85 per cent of respondents were potentially under-insured by industry standards, with only 5 times their annual earnings set aside as contingency funds for unexpected personal and financial events.A check with an employee of NTUC Income who wanted to be identified as Edwina says that the industry rule of thumb is to have 5 to 10 times your annual income as basic life cover. This means that, if you earn $5,000 a month, it would be prudent to opt for coverage of $300,000 to $600,000.That said, Edwina also says that this amount differs from case to case,because the longer you expect to take care of your dependents, the more you would need. Your financial adviser representative would probably be best placed to evaluate your protection needs.3) What does the policy cover?It is important to know what you are getting when purchasing a lifelong plan. Here is what you should be asking about the plan’s coverage:Don’t worry too much if this is overwhelming to you. Check with your insurance agent and he/she would have to go through the details above with you.Furthermore, according to Amanda from Great Eastern Advisors’ Clique, one should be aware that buying a plan is not comprehensive enough. It is also wise to add a couple of riders to the plan, such as an income protection rider which covers your monthly income up to a certain percentage until one turns 65 years old, early stage critical illness protection, accident plans, etc.4) Which one should you get: Whole Life vs Term insurance?There isn’t a right or wrong answer to the above question, as it depends broadly on your needs at various life stages, as well your preferences.The main differences between whole life and term insurance boils down to their coverage period and the premiums.As the name suggests, a whole life policy provides coverage for “life” and includes a savings element, such that there would be a death benefit payout provided by the insurance company if the policyholder dies.On the other hand, term insurance covers the policyholder for a certain period, usually until 65 or 70 years old. While this is much cheaper than whole life plans, it does not have a cash value at the end of your policy. As such, advocates of term insurance generally practise the rule of “Buy Term, Invest the Rest”.To sum up, it usually depends on whether the person is investment-savvy and willing to invest the premium savings. I have heard of many risk-averse friends who are more open to buying these insurance policies and treating it as a long-term savings plan instead.5) What is the payout procedure like when it comes to claims?According to the Life Insurance Association Singapore, there are still more than 8,000 unclaimed insurance payouts in Singapore – so they have come up with an online register here.Nowadays, one can easily go online to submit a claim by preparing the required documents, such as identification documents and proof of relationship as well as filling up the claim form.Alternatively, if you are still having a difficult time, you could also look for the claimant’s financial planner who would be well-versed in this area for further advice."

34,"Series D financing values Feedzai well above $1 billion Capital to be used to further strengthen company’s market-leading position SAN MATEO, Calif. and LISBON, Portugal, March 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Feedzai, the world’s leading cloud-based financial risk management platform, today announced a $200 million Series D investment round led by leading global investment firm KKR, with participation from existing investors Sapphire Ventures and Citi Ventures. The new investment will be used to accelerate the company’s global expansion, further develop its product offerings, and boost its partner strategy to strengthen its position as one of the most comprehensive financial crime prevention and risk management solutions in the market. Feedzai’s platform is used by the world’s leading financial institutions, payment providers, and merchants to manage the risk of financial crime while enabling an optimized experience for end-users. The core of Feedzai’s offering is its artificial intelligence and machine learning platform, which processes customer and third-party data to identify, assess, and accelerate the remediation of potential threats. The net result of this approach is significantly higher rates of financial crime detection with lower rates of false positives in contrast to legacy, often rules-based approaches, and meaningful cost savings for customers through fewer charge-backs, more efficient triage of alerts, and avoidance of regulatory fines. In addition, Feedzai’s technology allows a more seamless, real-time experience for consumers. Feedzai’s core offering originally focused on identifying transaction fraud, but in recent years has leveraged the underlying technology to expand into adjacencies such as anti-money laundering and account opening – making Feedzai one of the most comprehensive cloud-based financial crime prevention platforms in the market. The investment comes as demand for Feedzai’s technology is accelerating alongside the rapid shift to digital banking and commerce, which has led to a significant increase in consumers becoming victims of financial crime. In the last quarter of 2020 alone, consumers faced a 650% increase in account takeover scams, a 600% increase in impersonation scams, and a 250% increase in online banking fraud attacks compared to the first quarter in the same year, according to Feedzai’s data. Today, Feedzai monitors companies with more than 800 million customers in 190 countries, with products protecting half of the U.K.’s and Canada’s populations, as well as four of the five largest banks in North America. Many of the world's largest financial institutions, such as Citibank, Fiserv, and Santander, as well as the world's most innovative Fintechs such as SoFi and Mox by Standard Chartered, already use Feedzai’s AI-powered risk management solutions. Every time someone opens a bank account, transfers money, or makes a payment with their mobile device, they are experiencing transparency, convenience, and protection in 3 milliseconds or less - all made possible by Feedzai’s AI platform. “Feedzai’s technology is the cornerstone of today’s commerce as consumers across the globe expect fast, reliable, seamless, and, above all, secure banking and payment experiences. The world has faster digitization requirements, and financial institutions need reliable solutions that thrive in this new digital environment in days, not months,” said Nuno Sebastiao, CEO and Chairman of Feedzai. “We’re thrilled to be working with KKR to bring more innovation into this space and to keep protecting our customers from an ever-evolving financial crime landscape.” ""Feedzai offers a powerful solution to one of the biggest challenges we are facing today: financial crime in the digital age. Global commerce depends on future-proof technologies capable of dealing with a rapidly evolving threat landscape. At the same time, consumers rightfully demand a great customer experience, in addition to strong security layers when using banking or payments services,” said Stephen Shanley, Managing Director at KKR. Spencer Chavez, Principal at KKR, continued, “We believe Feedzai’s platform uniquely meets these expectations and more, and we are looking forward to working with Nuno and the rest of the team to expand their offering even further.” The investment follows the close of another exceptional financial year where Feedzai saw significant growth in all its geographic markets and customer verticals. In addition to its core offering, the company recently launched “Feedzai Solutions,” an initiative aimed at democratizing the fight against financial crime by allowing financial institutions of all sizes to benefit from the most advanced technology available today in an “out-of-the-box” format. The company has also expanded its Responsible AI framework, which was recently recognized as “Fraud Prevention Innovation of the Year” by Fintech Breakthrough, to allow financial institutions to provide the best customer experience possible while ensuring that Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) become part of the decision-making process.

23,What can you tell me about your company?,"Before getting into the major questions of how much life insurance you need or whether you want term or permanent insurance, do some homework on the company, says Allen McLellan, associate dean and assistant professor of insurance at The American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa.“You need to know how long the company has been in business, the size of it (and) its ratings,” he says. “You also want to ask the agent, ‘What are your credentials for being a life insurance professional?’”McLellan says consumers can research the financial strength of their life insurance company by checking out their fiscal ratings through organizations such as AM Best, Standard and Poor and Weiss. When it comes to the life insurance agent, McLellan says to look for designations such as Chartered Life Underwriter, Certified Financial Planner and Chartered Financial Consultant.“These designations take up to 10 semester-long courses to acquire,” he says. “Those who come out of those courses are, at least knowledge-wise, going to be quite professional.”Consumers will also want to know if their agent sells insurance from one particular insurance company or multiple firms."
24,How is my life insurance need determined?,"One of the most common life insurance questions is “how much life insurance will I need?” The answer to this question involves two major factors: how much it will take to pay your debts off, including the mortgage, and how much your dependents will need to maintain the same lifestyle after you’re gone. Though all companies factor those two variables in, insurance providers frequently use different formulas for determining your specific insurance need, says Bradley Behrendt, a CFP with Tax & Financial Group based in Newport Beach, California.“[Consumers need to ask] how did the adviser come up with the [appropriate] amount of insurance?” Behrendt says. “Was it a ballpark figure? Was it based on an analysis? If so, how deep was the analysis?”Understanding how your need is determined is crucial, especially for families with unusual debts, such as high medical bills, that may not be considered in a rudimentary-needs formula. Once policy shoppers are sure their insurance agent is taking all of their current and future financial needs into consideration, they can purchase a policy that fits their family."
25,How much will this policy cost?,"The cost of your life insurance policy will depend on a variety of important factors. Your life insurance agent will need to know your age, gender, lifestyle, the type of life insurance you need and your medical status, which may involve a required physical from a medical doctor.Knowing these factors will help the life insurance company assess your risk level. The higher your risk level, the higher your life insurance premium will be.“While your age, health, and smoking status play a huge role in how much you pay for life insurance, there are other important factors. Underwriters also consider your credit, occupation, hobbies, and driving record. The more dangerous your activities during work and leisure time–such as piloting airplanes, skydiving, or scuba diving–the higher your life insurance rate will be,” says insurance expert, Laura Adams.Though the average cost of life insurance is $44 per month, your premium may be different from that depending on your current risk level.If you run into a situation where you can’t pay the premium, knowing your options is invaluable. Butler says term policyholders who can’t pay their premiums typically have a 60- to 90-day grace period to come up with the money, but permanent policyholders have more options.“(Permanent policyholders) can take an ‘automatic premium loan’ and borrow against the cash value of the policy to pay the premiums,” she says. “If you’re going to borrow against the cash value, you’ll want to ask what the loan rate is, and those are usually anywhere between five (percent) and eight percent.”The added bonus of borrowing against your policy is you don’t have to pay it back, but you should understand how borrowing against a cash value policy could affect your future returns and death benefit."
26,Does the policy provide living benefits?,There is a common misconception that life insurance only provides death benefits. You may be surprised to learn that many life insurance policies also provide living benefits like the one we mentioned above where you may be able to borrow against the cash value of the policy.Living benefits involve benefits you can use while you’re still living. These will vary by company and policy type and are definitely something you want to know.These are some common living benefits that may be available under your life insurance policy:Talk with the insurance provider to see if these options are available if you’re interested in them.
27,What’s guaranteed?,"If purchasing a permanent policy, consumers need to pay careful attention to their life insurance illustration, says McLellan.“Another question (consumers should) ask is ‘What are the guarantees associated with this product?’” he says.While life insurance illustrations frequently provide several projections on how your policy could pay out down the road, McLellan says the numbers that really count are the “guaranteed” figures, which show how much you’ll make regardless of fluctuations in the market or fiscal problems the insurance provider may encounter in years to come."
28,When can I expect returns?,"This won’t be a question for term purchasers, but those eyeing permanent policies should be prepared to wait several years before their policy will start generating positive returns.“Expect that 100 percent of your first-year premiums will go to issuing the policy,” says Behrendt, adding that most of it will be paid to the agent as commission.He says permanent life insurance policies are designed as long-term savings vehicles and can take anywhere from five to 10 years to generate positive returns. New purchasers who see green in their immediate future could be sorely disappointed."
29,What if my health changes?,"Unless you’re buying a guaranteed-issue policy or purchasing life insurance through your employer, you’ll probably have to endure a medical evaluation. The problem is that over the duration of your policy, your health could change for better or worse.“If you don’t get the highest (health) classification when you apply for the policy, you need to ask if there is the ability to improve on that rating if your health increases,” says Behrendt.Behrendt says people who have had health risks such as a heart attack, DUI, or smoking habit in the past can have between 10 percent and 20 percent knocked off of their life insurance premium if they undergo new medical underwriting after a certain period of time. Policyholders, especially those with term insurance, will also want to know what happens if their health decreases or if they become uninsurable."
30,What’s covered if I become disabled?,"Even if you don’t purchase a disability rider or a separate disability insurance policy, some life insurance policies provide some benefits for policyholders who become disabled.“Usually those benefits are a disability premium waiver,” says Adam Sherman, CEO of Firstrust Financial Resources life insurance advisory firm in Philadelphia. “For example, if you have a $5,000 (annual) premium and you were deemed to be disabled, the company would provide that $5,000 for that policy.”Sherman is quick to point out that insurance companies have different definitions for “disabled.” While some providers define it as an inability to perform your specific occupation, others define it as an inability to perform any occupation at all. Being clear on what defines disability and whether your life insurance waives premiums in the event of catastrophe can help you find the right policy and determine your need for additional riders."
31,Will the death benefit adjust for inflation?,"“If we’re talking about (a death benefit) that’s anywhere from 20 to 80 years away, we need to talk about having that death benefit increased (over time),” says Butler.A $500,000 death benefit may seem enormous today, but 30 years down the road, it will only be worth approximately $200,500 after adjusting for inflation. With inflation increasing approximately 3 percent each year, time alone can severely erode your life insurance policy even if you never miss a payment. While some policies automatically adjust to keep pace with inflation, some companies sell that feature as an additional rider. Before signing onto a policy, Butler advises shoppers to ask their life insurance agent if the policy automatically factors in inflation and allows them to buy more insurance later on if necessary."
32,What happens to life insurance as I age?,"Your fiscal needs will change as you age. The terms and conditions of your policy might as well. While most term policies will eventually allow you to convert to a permanent policy, Sherman says you may not want to do so.“Usually you have to convert by age 70,” Sherman says. “For people in their later years, it’s very, very expensive. For example, if I’m a 45-year-old and I buy a term policy for $1 million, that could cost $1,300 (per year) today. If I wanted to convert that same policy at age 65, the premium could be $15,000 a year.”To save thousands of dollars down the road, ask your life insurance agent about the future of your policy."
33,The bottom line,"Understanding your life insurance policy and the provider is important. Life insurance needs will change over the years and so having a great relationship with your agent and knowing what life insurance questions to ask will help to ensure you are always adequately covered. As insurance expert, Laura Adams said,“Remember that certain life events, such as getting married or divorced, or having a child, should prompt you to review your life insurance beneficiaries. Make sure the policy payment would go to the people or organizations you want. Also, consider if you still have the right amount of coverage. A company representative can review your situation and advise you about having enough life insurance to protect your loved ones.” "

0,Question #1: Are you licensed by the MAS?,"Insurance products are among the most tightly regulated financial products in Singapore. Like banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies come under the purview of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).When considering life insurance providers, ask any candidates you’re considering whether or not they’re licensed by the MAS. That goes not just for the provider, but for any agents you’re working with as well. In September 2015, the Singapore-based arm of Mercer was fined SGD 15,000 for allowing employees to sell insurance policies when they hadn’t passed the Capital Markets and Financial Advisory Services exam.Be safe, rather than sorry, by confirming providers’ licenses before going further."
1,, 
2,Question #2: What type of life insurance policies do you offer?,"Generally speaking, there are three primary types of life insurance:These three types of insurance have their own benefits. Term life insurance, for example, is flexible and customisable, while whole life insurance provides a cash value upon surrender. Meanwhile, universal life functions as a wealth-building vehicle that can benefit your family after your death. A good insurance agent can help you determine which policy type is most appropriate for your needs.
 "
3,Question #3: Will you help me choose my cover?,"Term, whole life or universal life insurance isn’t the only question you need to be asking when deciding on a policy to buy. You also need to consider factors such as:The result of these different factors is that there is no single policy that’s right for everybody. Instead, it’s important that you choose a provider who can help you navigate the quoting process to ensure you select the right type and amount of cover. For example, with Singapore Life’s 100% digital journey, you can easily customise the term life policy needed for your unique situation.If the life insurance provider you’re considering does not offer this type of support, consider looking elsewhere.
 "
4,Question #4: Will my policy cover me if I become disabled?,"Life insurance is meant to pay out benefits in the event of your death, providing support for your dependents and offsetting any end-of-life costs. But what if an injury or illness causes you to become disabled, instead of dying outright?It’s an important question. Although only 3.4 percent of Singapore residents aged 18-49 years are disabled, 13.3 percent of residents over age 50 are designated as disabled. Your risk of disability – including all of the financial burdens that come along with being unable to work – increases as you age. Having disability protections in place (whether as part of your policy or as a separate rider) can minimise the negative impacts of becoming disabled.
 "
5,Question #5: Will I be required to have a medical evaluation?,"With life insurance policies, it is common practice to require a medical evaluation once a certain amount of cover has been requested (at Singapore Life, for example, you can purchase a term life insurance policy of up to SGD 2 million before an exam is required).Insurance providers base their premium amounts on many factors. Smokers or those who are obese, for instance, typically pay more, based on their average life expectancy and rates of disease. Medical evaluations play a key role in determining which of several pricing tiers life insurance applicants fall into and, thus, how much they’ll pay for cover."
6,Question #6: What is excluded from my cover?,"Every life insurance policy is different, which means you can’t make assumptions about the specific scenarios that are covered.If there are particular circumstances you are concerned about – such as cover for a serious disease – ask questions of potential providers and read the fine print of any documentation they provide. It’s crucial to know for sure that your policy covers you for the risks you are concerned about, than to be let down by cover that doesn’t provide relief when you need it.
 "
7,Question #7: What happens if I miss a payment?,"No one likes to think about financial challenges, such as an unexpected bill or lost job. Yet, these situations can and do occur – often unexpectedly.Plan ahead by asking potential life insurance providers what will happen to your policy in the event of a missed payment. Is there a grace period during which you can reinstate your cover by paying your premiums in full? At what point will you have to reapply for new cover?Consider the case of term life insurance. The older an applicant is, the higher the premiums tend to be. If you allow your policy to lapse after years of cover, you may find yourself subject to higher rates if you are forced to reapply at an older age.
 "
8,Question #8: Do you offer any savings or rewards opportunities?,"Depending on the life insurance provider you choose to work with, savings or rewards opportunities may be available that help offset the cost of your policy premiums.Singapore Life offers the Stay Active health programme, which uses fitness trackers and pedometers to measure your activity. If your device records a higher number of steps than half of your Singapore Life peers, you’ll earn a 5% cash back bonus for the month (an additional 5% cashback is available for posting about the program on social media). Other providers may offer discounts based on payment schedules, payment types or other policy elements.Remember, it never hurts to ask! You won’t know which discounts or rewards are available to you unless you ask in the first place."
9,Question #9: How can I access my policy documents?,"Convenience is key when you need to access your policy documents. Check with every life insurance provider you’re considering to see how they make your documentation available.Will you need to reference or request paper versions of your key documents? Or does the provider offer an online portal that will allow you to view digital versions whenever you need to? For instance, many Singapore Life customers appreciate the ability to store their documents online and retrieve their documents instantly, using our fully-digital system. It’s all about speed, access, convenience and how your life insurance policy fits our fast-paced digital age.
 "
10,Question #10: How can I get help with my policy?,"Finally, try to find out how easy it is to get in touch with the customer care teams of different providers. Are they available by phone, email, live chat or some combination of these channels? How long do you have to wait for a response using each of them?If your provider is slow to get back to you before you’re even a customer, they may be equally as slow – if not more so – once you’ve signed on. Questions about your policy may be able to wait through these delays, but in the event of an emergency, you’ll appreciate having a provider who’s quick to respond to your inquiries and help you navigate challenges efficiently."

What is this health insurance plan’s prescription drug coverage like?,"According to Georgetown University, two-thirds of all adults in the United States use prescription drugs, so there’s a fair chance you will, too (if you’re not already).It’s not unusual for people to get so focused on the medical details of their health insurance plan they forget to look at the prescription drug coverage. These costs can add up, so be sure to review the plan’s formulary (drug list).The formulary will tell you which drugs are covered and how much they’ll cost. That way, you can better plan your budget for any current drugs you’re taking (and any future ones you might need, like antibiotics).Related questions to ask:"

Curious about acupuncture?Different health plans treat alternative therapies (alternative medicine) different ways. In some cases, you’ll be covered the same as any other care. In other cases, you’ll only be covered a little or not at all. If this kind of care matters to you, take a close look at your plan’s benefits.Related questions to ask:"
7,8. Are there extra perks and benefits that come with this plan?,"Health insurance plans aren’t all about numbers, medical coverage and drug coverage. Oftentimes, there are additional perks and benefits that can really help you improve your health or save money.For example, will you have access to health coaches? Will you get a discount on your gym membership, or at the grocery store? Are there visits to a virtual clinic, like Virtuwell , at no cost to you?

That way, you’ll have a good understanding of how different changes will affect your and your family’s coverage.Related questions to ask:"

0, What is MyShield? ,"  MyShield is a Medisave-approved Integrated Shield Plan (IP) which offers additional benefits on top of what is provided by MediShield Life. It is a non-participating, guaranteed renewable annual premium plan denominated in Singapore dollars. It consists of MyShield Plan 1, Plan 2, Plan 3 and Standard Plan.  "
1, Does MediShield Life duplicate the coverage I have under MyShield and/or MyHealthPlus? ,"  There is no duplicate coverage. MyShield is made up of two parts – a basic MediShield Life portion run by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board, and additional coverage provided by Aviva. MyHealthPlus, which you can purchase from Aviva on top of MyShield, covers the co-insurance and/or deductible that you otherwise have to pay. Here are some of the MediShield Life and MyShield benefits at a glance:       Features MediShield Life MyShield     Hospital/ward type Provides cover at private hospitals, restructured hospitals, class B2 or C ward.   The coverage is pegged to class B2 or C ward in public hospitals. The coverage is subject to proration factor depending on the selected plan type.   Pre- & post-hospitalisation treatment No cover • Provides cover for Plan 1, 2 or 3 • No cover for Standard Plan    Coverage Capped at various claim limits • As-charged basis for most benefits for Plan 1, 2 or 3 • Capped at various claim limits for Standard Plan    Option to cover deductible and/or co-insurance No • Yes, with MyHealthPlus attached to MyShield Plan 1, 2 or 3 • Not available for Standard Plan    Allows choice of doctor No Yes      "
2, Will I receive premium subsidies even though I am insured under MyShield? Do I have to downgrade from MyShield plan to MediShield Life to receive the premium subsidies? ,"  You will still be able to receive the applicable MediShield Life subsidies (refer to https://www.moh.gov.sg/medishield-life/medishield-life-premiums-and-subsidies/ for more information on the subsidies) if you meet the eligibility criteria, even if you are insured under MyShield. You do not have to downgrade your MyShield plan to receive the subsidies.

You may receive your insurance payout either by cheque or direct credit into your bank account 90 days after the claim date and having been certified by an Appointed Assessor as severely disabled.

If you have finished paying all required premiums under the limited premium payment term option, no additional premium payment is necessary. You will still continue to enjoy lifetime coverage.   "
13, What happens if I do not pay premiums? ,"  To prevent your policy from lapsing due to non-payment of premiums, you may convert your policy into a paid-up policy with a reduced monthly benefit after a certain minimum number of years, provided that you have sufficient value accumulated under your MyCare policy.

17," Why do I need to wait 90 days after lodgement of my claim, before I could get my payouts if I become severely disabled? ","  MyCare payouts commence once the certification is complete and the 90 day 'deferment period' has ended. The deferment period ensures that MyCare policy payouts are used to cover long term nursing and care costs resulting from disabling illness or injury. Without this period, ElderShield Supplement Insurers would have to cover costs for temporary or non-severe disabilities, driving up premium prices for all policy holders.   "
18, Do I have to bear the cost of assessment? ,"  If your claim for severe disability insurance is successful, Aviva will reimburse the full cost of your assessment. If your claim is denied, you will be responsible for the cost of the assessment. Appointed Assessors charge $100* per assessment at their premises.

The purpose of having the panel of Appointed Assessors to conduct the assessments is to minimize inappropriate claims and ensure consistency in the claims assessment.

20, What can I do if I disagree with the claims assessment of the insurer? ,"  If you disagree with your assessment results, you can request to be assessed again by a specialist.
