You can transfer the rights on your life insurance policy to another person/entity for various reasons. This process is referred to as Assignment and is governed under Policies of Assurance Act (Chapter 392).\n\nThe person who assigns the insurance policy is called the Assignor (policy owner) and the one to whom the policy has been assigned, i.e. the person to whom the policy rights have been transferred is called the Assignee.\n\nOnce the rights have been transferred from the Assignor to the Assignee, the rights of the policy owner terminates and the assignee becomes the owner of the insurance policy. Under Singapore law, only the Assignee can give a valid discharge of all payment obligations to the insurer.\n\nA notice of assignment must be given to the insurer at its principle place of business, and the date on which such notice was received shall regulate the priority of all claims under any assignment.\n\nIf the premiums of the policy are not paid, whether by the assignor or the assignee, the policy may lapse. In the event that the policy is lapsed, the assignee will not be entitled to any benefits under the policy.\n\n<b>Who can Assignment of Policy?</b>\nOnly the policy owner of the life insurance policy can assign the policy.\n\nIf the assignor (i.e policy owner) is a natural person, he/she must have attained at least 18 years of age to assign a policy. The assignee, as a natural person, must also have attained at least 18 years of age at the assignment.\n\n<b>How to Assignment of Policy?</b>\nYou must use relevant assignment <a href=\"https://www.prudential.com.sg/services/claims/nominations/assignment-of-policy\">form.</a>\n\nWhile Prudential has assisted in preparing the assignment form, Prudential does not accept legal responsibility for the appropriateness of the assignment or its wordings or the effectiveness of the assignment or any other legal or tax consequences of this document in relation to any particular policy. If you have any doubts, you should consult a lawyer.\n\nBoth assignor and assignee must read all instructions and notes stated in the assignment form before completing it with utmost due care. Only an original copy of the duly completed Deed of Absolute Assignment can be registered.\n\nThe policy to be assigned must be in force and must not be subject to any Trust Nomination or under Housing Protection Scheme purposes at the time of the assignment.\n\n<b>Where to submit the notice of Assignment?</b>\nYou must submit the completed assignment form and mandatory requirements/documents to Prudential Assurance Company Singapore (Pte) Limited at its principle place of business via one of the following ways:\n\nBy Post to: Prudential Assurance Company Singapore (Pte) Limited Robinson Road P.O. Box 492 Singapore 900942\n\nBy Hand to: PRUCustomer Centre at Marina One The Heart #01-18/19, 5 Straits View Singapore 018935\n\nIf you have any enquiry, please call your financial consultant or our PRUCustomer Line at 1800 333 0 333 or <a href=\"mailto:customer.service@prudential.com.sg\">Email Us.</a>.<br>"

Essentially, the younger you are, the better the deal you get, which means a better premium at a cheaper price. <br>\n2. You qualify for a more comprehensive coverage <br> The younger and healthier you are, the higher the number of options you have, and you get to be as picky as you want about your medical plans. The older you get, you become more susceptible to illnesses – so the fewer your options and you have to eventually settle for a plan that the insurance company can offer you. <br>\n3. Get early protection from lifestyle-related illnesses<br>Our lifestyles are constantly changing – it’s not the same as it was about 20 to 30 years ago. Most working professionals today resort to a more sedentary lifestyle, which has increased the likelihood of people suffering from hypertension, obesity, and more. The younger generation also lead lifestyles today where they consume plenty of junk food and fast food, as well as increased exposure to pollution. These can all lead to lung cancer, clogged arteries, heart attacks. <br>\nWant to know more?
